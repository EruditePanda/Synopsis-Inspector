# Synopsis-Inspector

Synopsis Inspector allows for realtime browsing,  comparison and examination, sorting, searching, filtering and visual grouping of videos and metadata analyzed by "Synopsis Analyzer".

See the [Synopsis website for more info](http://synopsis.video)

Synopsis Inspector automatically finds all analyzed movies and presents a collection browsing experience. Movies can be sorted by their perceptual similarity as based by image/movie hashing algorithms - color similarity, motion similarity, and more.
